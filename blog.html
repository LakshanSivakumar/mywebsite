            First off we have to compare the specifications to android phones in the similar price range.

        As we all know iPhones are absolute monsters when it comes to raw performance. The in-house processors that Apple designs for the iPhone are 
        way<br> ahead of the industry. For example when we compare the latest <strong>Apple's A13 Bionic Chip</strong> to the likes of the <strong>Snapdragon 855</strong> Apples processors smashes<br> it out of 
        the water.

            The display of the iPhone is a straightforward debate when it comes to using it for gaming. <strong>WE NEED 120HZ!</strong> The iPhone has a measly 60HZ refresh rate<br>which is 
            near <strong>obsolete</strong> in 2020. Most android phones are now switching over to at least 90Hz screens such as Oneplus and Samsung. Now iPhone has this gimmick feature<br>
            called 120Hz touch sample rate. This is not exactly 120Hz but it is more about how fast it responds to touch. So in reality it makes using the iPhone more smooth but the rate information<br>
            is getting updated on the screen is the same is 60Hz. In conclusion, <strong>120Hz is a must have</strong> for iPhones in this day and age.

            The battery life of the iPhones are just phenomenal. The 7nm process improves the efficiency of the chip by up to a staggering <strong>40%</strong>.
